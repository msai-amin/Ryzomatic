        <p class="mb-6"><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2, 2025</p>

        <p class="mb-4">Welcome to ryzomatic.net ("we," "us," or "our"). ryzomatic.net is owned and operated by VStyle.ca. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your information when you use our cloud-native intelligent reading platform (the "Service").</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">
            1. Information We Collect
        </h2>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">a) Account Information</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">When you create an account, we use <strong>Supabase</strong> for authentication. We may collect your email address and a securely hashed password or information from a third-party login provider (e.g., Google, GitHub).</p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">b) User-Uploaded Content (Documents)</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">You may upload documents (such as PDFs and text files) to the Service. Your documents are securely uploaded to and stored on <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3</strong>. This allows you to access your content across multiple devices.</p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">c) Application & Metadata</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">To provide a seamless, synced experience, we store application data in our <strong>Supabase database</strong>. This includes:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Your user preferences (e.g., theme, font size).</li>
            <li>Document metadata (e.g., file names, page count).</li>
            <li>Your highlights and annotations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">d) AI & Text-to-Speech (TTS) Feature Data</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">Our Service uses <strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong> to provide advanced features.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li><strong>AI Chat:</strong> When you use the AI Chat feature, the relevant text content from your document is sent to <strong>Google's Gemini AI</strong> API to generate a response.</li>
            <li><strong>Text-to-Speech:</strong> When you use the TTS feature, the text you select is sent to <strong>GCP Text-to-Speech</strong> to generate audio.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">We do not store the content of your AI requests or TTS audio files after the request is completed, other than temporary caching for performance.</p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">e) User-Provided API Keys</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">To enable the AI and TTS features, the Service may require you to provide your own API keys for Google Cloud Platform. These keys are securely stored and encrypted in our <strong>Supabase database</strong>. They are used <em>only</em> by our backend services to make API calls to GCP on your behalf and are not visible to us in plain text.</p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-2">f) Anonymous Usage Data</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">We may collect standard, anonymous server logs when you access the Service. This may include your IP address, browser type, and access times, as well as logs from our service providers (AWS, Supabase, and GCP). This data is used only for monitoring the Service's health, debugging, and ensuring security.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">
